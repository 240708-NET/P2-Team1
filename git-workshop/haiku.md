"Hello world"
Breezes touch the leaves,
whispers of the ancient trees—
time’s quiet embrace.
Sand dampness sand dunes
A glorious bird bounces
before the tiger
We enjoy coding
We make a really good team
We are Revature
Hey there all of y'all
Everybody done love this
Don't even worry
"Goodbye cruel world!"
